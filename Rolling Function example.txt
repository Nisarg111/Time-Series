consider ar = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
we have rolling function with window size 2
First two value of output will be NaN because window size
Then we will take 2 element find their average (1+2)/2
Then we will slide window by 1 so their average(2+3)/2
and so on.

answer = [NaN,NaN,(1+2)/2,(2+3)/2,(3+4)/2...]
